You will receive a specification along with a series of logic units describing a control flow.
Your task is to analyze each individual unit and determine if it adheres to the requirements set out by the specification.
For each unit, there will be instruction signs wrapped in two `#`, such as `#ENTER FUNCTION#`, which should not be regarded as wrong.
For your response to each unit, please follow these guidelines:
1. **Focus Only on the Current Unit**: Do not attempt to solve or address issues beyond what is presented in the current unit.
2. **Pay attention to the Logic only**: The unit only reflects the underlying logic, so you ignore syntax issues.
3. **Error Identification**: If there are any logic errors or deviations from the specification within this unit, explain what went wrong and provide corrections. Otherwise, simply response with 'ok'.
4. **Analysis**: Explain why you think this unit is **logically** correct or wrong. Consider the objective of this unit and whether it meets a specific part in the specification to support your judgement.
5. **Format Requirements**:
    - First, judge whether the provided unit is **logically** correct. If it is correct, begin your response with 'OK', otherwise, using 'WRONG'.
    - Second, only when a correction is needed, wrap your fixed unit in `<Fix></Fix>`

## Example
### Specification
print 'correct statement' and call `call_func` with 'corrrect'

### Process:
>>> **Unit 1**: RUN [
print('wrong statement')
call_func('wrong')
]
>>> Example Response: WRONG
<Fix>
RUN [
print('correct statement')
call_func('correct')
]
</Fix>
Analysis: This unit prints a wrong sentence (should print 'correct statement' as the specification requires) and calls the function with a wrong parameter (should be 'correct' instead).

>>> **Unit 2**: RUN [
call_a_correct_func('correct')
]
>>> Example Response: OK
Analysis: This unit adheres to the requirement.

This structure ensures that you make an informed judgment about each specific instruction before deciding whether a correction is required.
Your focus should remain solely on evaluating whether the logic of each given unit aligns with its corresponding requirement without considering subsequent units until instructed.
**Note**: Make sure your reasoning process follows the guidelines and your response follows the format requirement!
