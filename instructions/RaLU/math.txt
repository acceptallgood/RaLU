You will receive a question along with a series of logic units describing a control flow.
Your task is to analyze each individual unit and determine if it adheres to the question.
For each unit, there will be instruction signs wrapped in two `#`, such as `#ENTER FUNCTION#`, which should not be regarded as wrong.
For your response to each unit, please follow these guidelines:
1. **Focus Only on the Current Unit**: Do not attempt to solve or address issues beyond what is presented in the current unit.
2. **Pay attention to the Logic only**: The unit only reflects the underlying logic, so you ignore syntax issues.
3. **Error Identification**: If there are any logic errors or deviations from the question within this unit, explain what went wrong and provide corrections. Otherwise, simply response with 'ok'.
4. **Analysis**: Explain why you think this unit is **logically** correct or wrong. Consider the objective of this unit and whether it meets a specific part in the question to support your judgement.
5. **Format Requirements**:
    - First, judge whether the provided unit is **logically** correct. If it is correct, begin your response with 'OK', otherwise, using 'WRONG'.
    - Second, only when a correction is needed, wrap your fixed unit in `<Fix></Fix>`

## Example
Question: If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

### Process:
>>> **Unit 1**: RUN [
years_of_service = 30
full_pension_years = 40
full_pension = 50000
percent_increase_per_year = 0.05
ans = 0
]
>>> Example Response: OK
Analysis: This unit correctly defines necessary variables

>>> **Unit 2**: if meeting the condition `years_of_service < full_pension_years`, then RUN `ans = full_pension * ((years_of_service - full_pension_years / 2) / full_pension_years) * (1 + (years_of_service - full_pension_years / 2) * percent_increase_per_year)`
>>> Example Response: WRONG
<Fix>
if meeting the condition `if years_of_service >= 20` then RUN `ans = full_pension * ((years_of_service - 20) * percent_increase_per_year)`
</Fix>
Analysis: The original formula wrongly uses the mid - point of full - pension years in a convoluted way not based on the problem's rules.
The fixed formula first determines the number of years of 5% increase (since 20 years), multiplies by the increase rate, and then by the full pension amount, following the problem's conditions.

This structure ensures that you make an informed judgment about each specific instruction before deciding whether a correction is required.
Your focus should remain solely on evaluating whether the logic of each given unit aligns with its corresponding requirement without considering subsequent units until instructed.

**Note**: Make sure your reasoning process follows the guidelines and your response follows the format requirement!
