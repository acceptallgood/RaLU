Question: Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?
# Python code, return ans
<code>
num_glasses = 16
first_glass_cost = 5
second_glass_cost = 5 * 0.6
ans = 0
for i in range(num_glasses):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        ans += first_glass_cost
    else:
        ans += second_glass_cost
</code>

Analysis: The code first sets up the necessary variables to represent the number of glasses, the cost of the first glass, and the cost of the second glass.
The for loop iterates over each glass (from 0 to 15, representing the 16 glasses).
Inside the loop, it checks if the index i is even or odd. If it's even, it adds the cost of the first glass ($5) to the total cost ans. If it's odd, it adds the cost of the second glass ($3) to ans.
By the end of the loop, ans contains the sum of the costs of all 16 glasses.

Question: Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it tak
e before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?
# Python code, return ans
<code>
total_cost = 90
cost_of_watering_and_feeding = 3
cost_of_each_lemon = 1.5
num_of_lemon_per_year = 7
ans = 0
while total_cost > 0:
    total_cost += cost_of_watering_and_feeding
    total_cost -= num_of_lemon_per_year * cost_of_each_lemon
    ans += 1
